### This is the 2-stage task (Daw et al., 2011) taken from Experiment Factory (Sochat et al., 2016) and adjusted to be used with jatos by Rani Gera. Also added pre-loading of the images, some "meta data" and automatically move to google forms questionnaires when completing the task. 
### important:
#### The subID is taken from what comes after a hash in the url e.g.: www...../XXX#999 will make it subID 999. To run a subject get into jatos on the server, get a personal worker link, copy the link and add a hash with the subject number.

 * For the questionnaires link (if relevant), look for the place holder COMPLETE_GOOGLE_FORM_URL in index.html and insert the questionnaires link instead.
