This is the 2-stage task taken from Experiment Factory and adjusted to jatos by Rani. Also added pre-loading of the images and some "meta data". 
### important:
#### subID is taken from what comes after a hash in the url e.g.: www...../XXX#999 will make it subID 999. To run a subject get into jatos on the server, get a personal worker link, copy the link and add a hash with the subject number.
#### For backup also add the subject number in as a "comment" in jatos when requesting a worker link.
